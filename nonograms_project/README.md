# Assignment

The aim of the homework is to choose an interesting problem and solve it using various algorithms learned so far (genetic algorithm, smart swarm strategies). The whole thing should be put into a jupyter notebook that clearly presents the solution. The notebook should contain code inserts, their outputs, your comments on the code and results. The notebook should be sensibly divided into chapters: an introduction with a presentation of the problem, chapters with experiments, a summary and a bibliography.

## Version
