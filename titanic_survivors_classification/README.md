# Assignment

The goal of homework #2 is to select a larger and more interesting database, appropriate data processing, and then test how the learned classifier algorithms work on it.

The database can be numerical-categorical and we test basic classifiers (k-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Neural Networks).

## Version

Python: 3.10.1
